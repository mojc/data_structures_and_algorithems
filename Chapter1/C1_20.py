'''Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function shuffle(data) that accepts a
list of elements and randomly reorders the elements so that each possi-
ble order occurs with equal probability. The random module includes a
more basic function randint(a, b) that returns a uniformly random integer
from a to b (including both endpoints). Using only the randint function,
implement your own version of the shuffle function.'''

    shuffled_seq = [0]*(len(seq))
    for value in seq:
        new_index = random.randint(0, (len(seq)-1))
